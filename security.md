# **Reporting a Vulnerability** üõ°Ô∏è

Thank you for your vigilance in helping to maintain the security of this project. I take security concerns seriously and appreciate your efforts in reporting potential vulnerabilities promptly. This section outlines the process for reporting vulnerabilities and what you can expect during the process.

### Reporting Process

To report a vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Create an Issue:** Navigate to the project's GitHub repository and create a new issue. Provide a clear and concise title that reflects the nature of the vulnerability.

2. **Include Details:** In the issue description, provide a detailed explanation of the vulnerability. Include steps to reproduce the issue, relevant code snippets, and any additional information that can assist in understanding and addressing the problem effectively.

3. **Contact Information:** Include your contact information (preferably an email address) so that I can reach out for further clarification or updates regarding the reported vulnerability.

### Response and Update

Once a vulnerability is reported, I will review the issue promptly and respond within a reasonable timeframe. My goal is to acknowledge the report within 4 business days and provide an initial assessment of the vulnerability's severity.

### Vulnerability Assessment

After receiving your vulnerability report, I will conduct a thorough assessment to determine its validity and severity. During this process, I may request additional information or clarifications to ensure a comprehensive evaluation.

### Acceptance or Decline

- **Acceptance:** If the vulnerability is accepted, appropriate measures will be taken to address and fix the issue. I will provide you with expected timelines for resolving the vulnerability.
  
- **Decline:** If the vulnerability is deemed outside the scope of the project or does not pose a significant risk, it may be declined. I will provide a clear explanation for my decision and any recommended actions, if applicable.

### Public Disclosure

To ensure the safety and security of users, please refrain from publicly disclosing the vulnerability until I have had sufficient time to address it. I strive to resolve vulnerabilities in a timely manner and appreciate your cooperation in maintaining responsible security practices.

### Recognition

I deeply value the contributions of the security community. If you would like to be credited for your discovery, please let me know when submitting the report. Recognition is a small token of appreciation for your responsible reporting.
